# Medicinal Plants Detection Using Deep Learning

Welcome to the repository for my final year project titled "Deep Learning for Medicinal Plants Detection". This project was conducted as part of my Masterâ€™s program in Big Data & Data Science under the supervision of Pr. SAEL Nawal at Faculty of science Benmsik Casablanca.

## Project Overview

Medicinal plants have been a cornerstone of traditional and modern medicine, offering natural remedies for a wide range of diseases for centuries. However, accurately identifying and classifying these plants has traditionally relied on manual methods based on shape, texture, and color. These traditional methods pose challenges, including excessive computational time and high similarity rates between different species.

This project leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to overcome these challenges, paving the way for an automated and reliable system for the correct classification of medicinal plants.

## Objectives

Conduct experimental work using deep learning and image processing technology.
Compare various methods in terms of accuracy and ease of use.
Study existing research in the field and extract the methodologies used.

## Tools & Techniques

Deep Learning Models: Pre-trained CNN models such as InceptionV3, VGG16, MobileNetV2, among others.
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow.
Dataset: A collection of 1500 high-quality images representing 30 different species of medicinal plants.

## Results

The project demonstrated that InceptionV3 achieved the highest accuracy with a remarkable score of 97%, followed closely by VGG16 with 94%.
The use of deep learning models significantly improved the classification accuracy of medicinal plant species.

## Conclusion

This research contributes to the fundamental goal of better understanding and valuing plant biodiversity for human well-being. The results from this project provide promising insights into the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in the field of medicinal plant classification.
